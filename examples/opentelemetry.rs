    // Unlike traces, OpenTelemetry doesn't have a strong recommendation for applications to export
    // logs through OTLP, instead preferring whatever frameworks/conventions already exist for the
    // given programming language.

    // To send logs to OpenTelemetry as well, set up `opentelemetry-appender-tracing` as shown here:

    // Notice how it has to add filters for crates that it calls internally to avoid generating logs
    // in a loop. Since the `clickhouse` crate also uses some of these dependencies (namely `hyper`),
    // which might be useful have in logs, it didn't make sense to include this in the example
    // until this limitation was addressed.

    // Writing logs via `tracing-subscriber` directly avoids this issue.

    // `tracing-opentelemetry` also already converts `tracing` events as OTel "span events"
    // which are recorded in the context of their parent span, which is arguably more useful
    // than exporting events as logs anyway, which does not include trace metadata.
    // In this light, it would seem that exporting logs separately to OTel is simply redundant.
